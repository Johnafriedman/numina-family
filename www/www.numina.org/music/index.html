    I recorded the Temptations' iconic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Girl_(The_Temptations_song)"><b>My Girl</b></a> as a wedding present for my oldest friend Dave's marriage to Amy (both working musicians)</div>
    My Girl captures the simple joy of being in love. Dave and I used to play it in our band Biskets.<div><br /></div>
